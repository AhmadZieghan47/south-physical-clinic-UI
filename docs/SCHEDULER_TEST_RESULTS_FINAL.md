## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue #1: API Response Structure Bug ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Therapists and appointments not loading  
**Root Cause**: Incorrect response.data access  
**Fix**: Changed from `response.data` to `response.data.data` for paginated endpoints  

**Before:**
```typescript
const users = Array.isArray(response.data) ? response.data : [];
```

**After (Correct):**
```typescript
const users = response.data.data || [];
```

**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Grid now populates correctly

### Issue #2: Modal Pre-fill Not Working ⚠️ MINOR

**Problem**: Selected cell's therapist/hour not pre-filled in modal  
**Impact**: Low - users can still select manually  
**Priority**: Low  
**Status**: Known limitation - can enhance later

## 📝 Next Steps for Full Testing

### To Create a Successful Appointment:

**Option 1**: Use a patient with existing active plan
```sql
-- Find patients with active plans
SELECT p.id, p.full_name, tp.id as plan_id, tp.plan_status
FROM patient p
JOIN treatment_plan tp ON tp.patient_id = p.id
WHERE tp.plan_status = 'ONGOING'
LIMIT 5;
```

**Option 2**: Create a plan for patient 1
```sql
INSERT INTO treatment_plan (patient_id, plan_type, plan_status, remaining_sessions, total_sessions)
VALUES ('1', 'PAY_PER_VISIT', 'ONGOING', 10, 10);
```

Then try creating the appointment again!
